##Install Active Directory Users and group in windows -- Best way to enum the AD through GUI
Method 1: Powershell 

Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:
In powershell
# Install the Active Directory module only
PS > Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name "Rsat.ActiveDirectory.DS-LDS.Tools~~~~0.0.1.0" 

To confirm it's installed:
PS > Get-Module -ListAvailable -Name ActiveDirectory

Method 2: Install via Settings (GUI)
Go to Settings > Apps > Optional Features
Click on Add a feature
Search for:
RSAT: Active Directory Domain Services and Lightweight Directory Services
Click Install
Wait for it to finish (may take a few minutes)

Verify RSAT Installation
Open PowerShell and run:
PS > Import-Module ActiveDirectory
Get-ADUser -Filter * 

If it runs without error, RSAT is installed correctly.
